/*
 * Cephes polutes the namespace with extern definitions so we don't link to it directly.
 * math_interface.cc includes math/cephes/mconf.h which in turns includes math/cephes/cephes.h
 * (the main header with all the functions). It also redefines the functions needed, e.g. hyp2f1,
 * which is exposed in math_interface.hh.
 * So when calling rascal::math::hyp2f1 you call a function from librascal which uses a function from libcephes.
 * That is how the namespace is not polluted because only math_interface.cc sees it and it is a .cc
