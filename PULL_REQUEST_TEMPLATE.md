Fix # (optional)

Rationale and detailed description of the changes:

-

Tasks before review:

- [ ] Add tests, examples, and complete documentation of any added functionality
    - [ ] Make sure the autogenerated documentation appears in Sphinx and is
          formatted correctly (ask @max-veit if you need help with this task).
    - [ ] Write additional documentation in the Sphinx (not docstrings!) to
          explain the feature and its usage in plain English
    - [ ] Make sure the examples run (!) and produce the expected output
    - [ ] For bugfix pull requests, list here which tests have been added or re-enabled
          to verify the fix and catch future regressions as well as similar bugs
          elsewhere in the code.
- [ ] Run `make lint` on the project, ensure it passes
    - [ ] Run `make pretty-cpp` and `make pretty-python`, check that the
          auto-formatting is sensible
    - [ ] Review variable names, make sure they're descriptive (ask a friend)
    - [ ] Review all TODOs, convert to issues wherever possible
    - [ ] Make sure draft, in-progress, and commented-out code is moved to its
          own branch
- [ ] If committing any code in Jupyter/IPython notebooks, install and run `nbstripout`
- [ ] Merge with master and resolve any conflicts
- [ ] (anything else that's still in progress)

- [ ] Make sure to add these points to the issues or to the meeting agenda so they don't
get forgotten!
