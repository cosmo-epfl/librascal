Implementation
=================

Rascal is built as an efficient C++ core, that can be easily accessed
from Python. Coding philosophy and style conventions are discussed in the
Developer's guide dev_

Here we discuss the general structure of the code, the main objects that
are used, and the rationale for various design choices.

Structures and Clusters
-----------------------

An atomic structure is a collection of atoms, with properties associated
to it. In the most abstract way possible, properties can be attached to the
entire structure, to atoms, or to groups of atoms (pairs, triplets, ...)
which we refer to as "clusters".
For instance, the energy is a property associated to an entire molecule or
crystal structure, the nuclear chemical shift is a property associated to
atoms, a distance is a property of a pair of atoms, and so on.
We refer to the number of atoms involved in a cluster as the order of that
cluster. An atom is a cluster with `Order=1`, a pair is a cluster with
`Order=2` and so on.

Structure Managers
------------------


``StructureManager`` is the main class forming the backbone of Rascal.
It takes care of:

* Holding information about an atomic structure
* Building clusters based on existing structural information
* Filtering, sorting or modifying existing clusters
* Computing properties of clusters (e.g. distances, angles, ...)
* Providing iterators that can be used to loop over clusters of a given type,
  and to access properties associated with clusters of each body order.

In practice the ``StructureManager`` allocates the memory to store
property data, which can be accessed as a heterogeneous map containing
different types of properties. It also provides an interface to access
clusters in terms of iterators: the internal implementation of the
neighbor list is left to the implementation, and it only should allow
to retrieve ``ClusterRef`` objects, that act as a light pointer to the
sequential list of clusters, and contains the indices of the atoms involved
in the cluster.

``ClusterRef`` objects can be in turn iterated on, giving access to a
concise notation to iterate over atoms, pairs, triplets, ...

This is best explained with a code snippet

.. code-block:: c++

    StructureManager SM(structure_data); // assume this can compute pairs and distances
    SM.update();   // refreshes the list of pairs

    energy = SM.get_real(0, "energy") // structure-global property access
    //access to atomic positions, explicit typing
    pos = SM.get_3vec(1, "positions");
    // pos = SM.get("positions");  // implicit (slower)
    dist = SM.get_real(2, "distances");

    for (auto atom: SM) {
      // iterates over order-1 clusters (atoms)
      ri = pos[atom] //accesses the position of an iterated atom

      for (auto pair: atom) {
        // iterates over order-2 clusters (pairs)
        dij = dist[pair]  // accesses the distance between the two atoms

        rj = pos[pair]  // the cluster can be used to access properties of
                        // the last member of the cluster
      }
    }

Adaptors
--------

``AdaptorX`` are classes, which by *stacking* on top of a ``StructureManager``
or another ``Adaptor`` change the iteration of the underlying
``StructureManager``, where ``X`` refers to its functionality. There are
e.g. possibilities to increase the order, enforce strictness of a neighbourhood,
build triplets and filter by species, etc. ``X`` are:

* ``AdaptorNeighbourList`` builds a full neighbour list with the box algorithm.
* ``AdaptorStrict`` reduces an existing one, which is not strict with respect to
  the given cutoff to a strict one.
* ``AdaptorHalfList`` makes a minimal neighbour list from an existing full
  neighbour list (each pair exists only once, no permutation of indices).
* ``AdaptorFullList`` takes a minimal neighbour list and creates a full one
  (e.g. each pair exists twice, just permuted).
* ``AdaptorIncreaseMaxOrder`` increases an the Order of an existing neighbour
  list (minimum is a pair list). E.g. adds the possibility of iterating over
  triplets, given a pair list.

From the user side each ``Adaptor`` is usable like a ``StructureManager``. This
is because it is *stacked* upon an existing Manager, does not duplicate data,
creates only data and data structures, that are necessary for its intended use
and transparently hands requests for data through to the underlying
manager. Because of this transparency and the way they are used and accessed,
adaptors are from now on referred to as structure managers. The stacking is explained in the next section.

Stacking of StructureManagers
-----------------------------

Structure managers can be build in a modular fashion by stacking them on
top of each other. That is, one can add functionalities to an existing
manager by creating an adapter, which is just a structure manager that is
built based on a lower-level manager.
Each manager after the first (which can e.g. be built based on a input
structure, or fetching data from a host code such as LAMMPS) takes the
status of an existing manager and "adapts" it by computing properties,
creating clusters of higher order, or filtering existing clusters.

.. image:: ../figures/implementation_structure_layers-0.png
   :scale: 30
   :align: center

Conceptually this can be understood as if the state of a manager was
described by a series of layers, one for each cluster order, starting
from an empty slate in which no data exists. Each layer
knows how to reference clusters at a given level, and can possibly contain
new properties that are defined for each cluster it can index.

Consider for instance the following stack:

1. A structure is read from file, and contains only the list of atoms. Each
item in the index list corresponds to an atom, and can be used to index
associated properties, e.g. the position of each atom

  .. image:: ../figures/implementation_structure_layers-1.png
     :scale: 30
     :align: center

2. Pair clusters are computed with a linked-cell algorithm
[AllenTildesley]_. The parameters
of the manager determines how the pairs are constructed, and no distance is
actually computed and stored

  .. image:: ../figures/implementation_structure_layers-2.png
     :scale: 30
     :align: center

3. Distances are computed for a subset of the pairs, e.g. only for pairs
within a strict cutoff of 3â„«. Only a subset of the pairs computed at the
previous layer is indexed. We will discuss later how one can index multiple
layers without runtime overhead.

  .. image:: ../figures/implementation_structure_layers-3.png
     :scale: 30
     :align: center

4. Only oxygen atoms, and pairs involving oxygen atoms are selected. Note that
this adds a new layer to both atoms and pairs.

  .. image:: ../figures/implementation_structure_layers-4.png
     :scale: 30
     :align: center

5. Triplets of oxygen atoms are constructed, and angles computed between them.
A new layer is created for triplets and properties are simultaneously stored

  .. image:: ../figures/implementation_structure_layers-5.png
     :scale: 30
     :align: center

It is important to keep in mind that this architecture is not associated with a
separate control structure in the code, but is realized at compile time by
template algebra based on the ``StructureManager`` class. Structure managers
provide storage space for most of the data (both properties and indices) and
infrastructure to access this data with minimal memory duplication and
computational overhead.


ClusterRefs, Property and indexing
----------------------------------

The actual infrastructure to index and access cluster data is created at
compile time and linked statically, so despite the apparent complexity there
is little to no associated overhead.

.. image:: ../figures/implementation_clusterref.svg

Compile-time lookup of the appropriate property is achieved by means
of the ``ClusterRef`` object, that holds a list of the location in memory of
each cluster at a given layer in the hierarchy. A ``ClusterRef`` object is
an iterate, and an index that can be used to access properties. It can also
be used as a container to return an iterator to clusters of higher order, as
shown in the code snippets above.

Note that, once clusters of a given order have been created, Managers and
Adaptors can only select or reshuffle them, and not create new ones.
As a consequence, it is always possible to refer to deeper layers from
higher ones. A ``StructureManager`` object that introduces a new layer and
modifies clusters will create a cluster index array that specifies how each
of the clusters that is present at that layer is mapped onto deeper layers.
This means that higher layers can always access properties that have been
computed at a deeper level without the need for recomputing or duplicating
the data.

TODO: discussion of Properties, how they are indexed and how they can store
metadata.

RepManager
---------------

A ``RepManager`` object has the purpose of computing properties of
clusters, such as distances, angles, or more complex features such as
symmetry functions or SOAP power spectrum components, and to store them in
the Properties associated with the structure.
It needs to be initialized with a ``StructureManager`` and
a JSON formatted string that contains its hyperparameters.
This string will also be attached to the metadata of the returned
properties.

Structure Managers, RepManager and Python
----------------------------------------------

NOTE: this is more of a summary of a discussion we had about using this from
Python and what this entails in terms of the template definitions.

Let's say you wanted to be able to write code like this

.. code-block:: Python

  import rascal as ras

  sm = ras.load_structure("structure.xyz")
  sm = ras.compute_pairs(sm)
  sm = ras.adaptor_strict(sm, 3.0)

  rep = ras.SOAP(sm, hypers)
  sm = rep.compute()

The way we understand it,  this would make it impossible to have statically
typed structure managers, as we don't know how many stacks a user might
plug in before calling the representation builder.

So the idea we have to deal with this is that we should define a
`StructureManagerFull` object that would be the only structure manager object
available from Python. This should be general enough that every representation
can function with it without stacking anything on top, and have enough
flexibility to reuse between different representations (within reason).

So a typical representation constructor would have a mode of functioning
based on StructureManagerFull, that could go like

.. code-block:: c++

  RepManagerSOAP<StructureManagerFull> (StructureManagerFull& SM, hypers) {
    this->sm = SM;
    this->sm.initialize_pars_based_on_hypers(hypers);
    this->sm.update();
  }

and a generic constructor that would use template algebra to make sure that
whatever SM that is passed as a constructor has the functionality that is
needed to compute the representation.
